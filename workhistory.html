            <p>You will notice that my most recent position with Bonita Springs Utilities and my former position with DaVita Dialysis involved the acquisition and implementation of a highly technical skillset. While these specific skills are not relevant to the position with your company, my ability to learn and utilize them illustrates that I am capable of the type of thinking necessary to take on a new challenge and update my skills repertoire as needed.</p>
